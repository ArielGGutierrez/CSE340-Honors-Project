# CSE 340 Honors Contract
Ariel Gutierrez 1218982505

This is my submission for the honors contract for CSE340.  This project adds support for functions to the language specified in Project 3.
One thing that the honors contract file fails to address is scoping.  Because of time constraints I chose not to implement neither static
or dynamic scoping; functions will only be able to use variables that are within the scope of their local memory.  Other than that, I'd 
like to thank the professor for giving me this opportunity to learn more about how functions would be implemented in a programmming  language.
